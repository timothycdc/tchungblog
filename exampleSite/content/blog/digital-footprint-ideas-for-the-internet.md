Hi Epsomians!

Mr Barker recently featured my blog in an assembly, so here's an article to expand on that.

Enhance your digital footprint with starting a blog! I think it would be one of my most important achievements in Sixth Form. Read on...

#### Why Start a Blog?

* It provides a curated space for all your works and further supercurricular reading.
* A blog serves as written proof that is easily accessible online.
* When you write your[ Personal Statement](https://sites.google.com/epsomcollege.edu.my/igle-student/key-stages/sixth-form/university/personal-statements?pli=1&authuser=1), you'll have a great starting point to mention your blog and all your interests. I even linked my blog in my personal statement!
* Helps you find ideas â€“ my blog is like a motivational catalyst, pushing me to stay well-read and be proud of showcasing my work.
* Cool conversation starter, maybe in an interview?

#### Where do I start?

* Google's [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/about/?bpli=1) is still around after all these years, and is a nifty option with the least set-up effort. 
* A little more recent and polished option is [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/epsomcollege.edu.my/igle-student/key-stages/sixth-form?authuser=1), which was used to create Epsom's [IGLE](https://sites.google.com/epsomcollege.edu.my/igle-student/key-stages/sixth-form?authuser=1).
