Hi Epsomians!

Mr Barker recently featured my blog in an assembly, so here's an article to expand on that.

Enhance your digital footprint with starting a blog! I think it would be one of my most important achievements in Sixth Form. Read on...

### Why Start a Blog?

* It provides a curated space for all your works and further supercurricular reading.
* A blog serves as written proof that is easily accessible online.
* When you write your[ Personal Statement](https://sites.google.com/epsomcollege.edu.my/igle-student/key-stages/sixth-form/university/personal-statements?pli=1&authuser=1), you'll have a great starting point to mention your blog and all your interests. I even linked my blog in my personal statement!
* Helps you find ideas â€“ my blog is like a motivational catalyst, pushing me to stay well-read and be proud of showcasing my work.
* Cool conversation starter
* Good interview material for universities, it's something to talk about

### Where do I start?

* Google's [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/about/?bpli=1) is still around after all these years, and is a nifty option with the least set-up effort.
* A little more recent and polished option is [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/new), which was used to create Epsom's [IGLE website](https://sites.google.com/epsomcollege.edu.my/igle-student/key-stages/sixth-form?authuser=1).
* If you like unlimited customisations and extra features, try [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/pricing/?ref=logged-out-homepage-lp). You can either use Wordpress' hosting plan, or host it yourself using a separate server, which requires a bit more technical knowledge. I used the latter option to create a [website](ecim.scienceontheweb.net) for the ECiM Science Research Club.
* Some premium options include [Wix](https://www.wix.com/blog) and [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com).

###### More technical info (If you're curious as to how I made this blog)

* I coded this website using a static site generator (SSG), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), connected it to a Content Management System (CMS). I used [Forestry](forestry.io) as my CMS, and hosted it on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). 
* This blog was a modification of an existing [theme](), where I tinkered with the CSS and HTML to allow for displaying maths equations and menus.
* SSGs need to be deployed by a hosting service. To ease management of your blog, use a CMS.
* It definitely sounds like a lot, but it is a great skill to learn! Simply put, static sight generators are a more efficient way to produce simple sites on the internet. They have a reduced set of features and no support for server-end backing, limiting features such as user accounts.
* There are many tutorials on YouTube documenting how to create a blog with a static site generators such as Eleventy, Gatsby, and more.
