title = "A Seemingly Difficult DFM Maths Question"

+++
Just before summer holidays began, a friend of mine reached out and shared this question with me. It was an Argand Diagrams question taken from the Dr Frost Maths website:

\\begin{equation} 

A\\ complex\\ number\\ z\\ is\\ represented\\ by\\ the\\ point\\ P\\ on\\ an\\ Argand\\ Diagram.\\\\\\\\

Given\\ that\\ arg\\left(\\frac{z-6i}{z-3i}\\right)=\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\\\\\\\

The\\ sketch\\ of\\ the\\ locus\\ of\\ P\\ as\\ z\\ varies\\ is\\ shown\\ below.\\\\\\\\

Find\\ the\\ maximum\\ value\\ of\\ \\left|z\\right|.\\ (5 \\ marks)\\\\end{equation}

It didn't look too difficult at first, being only 5 marks. But what we did not know that the question required Y13 knowledge of polar coordinates (Core Pure 2).

It took me overnight to find a creative solution, but it was well worth it in the end.

\\begin{equation}

arg\\left(\\frac{z-6i}{z-3i}\\right)=\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\\\\\\\

\\therefore \\frac{\\pi}{3}=arg\\left(z-6i\\right)-arg\\left(z-3i\\right)\\\\\\\\

\\end{equation}

We know that the difference between the argument of a complex number _z_ from 6i and 3i is equal to pi/3 radians. 

Now, what? My Y12 knowledge takes me as far as here. 

Looking at Figure 2, I've chosen a point on the locus and drawn argument lines from 6i and 3i to the point and highlighted the angles. Note that these lines intersect creating an acute angle of pi/3.
